            Fireside is my favorite Discord bot by far! I love 
            its expansive feature list and interacting with the 
            developer has been a real pleasure. Support issues are 
            always addressed quickly and proactively, and I know I 
            can always rely on Fireside to entertain my server!

            Fireside is an excellent application in Discord. Anytime I 
            want to play music, it doesn't interrupt my streaming, gaming, 
            or calls in all my servers. This application is easy to install, 
            easy to program and premium allows me to go above and beyond for 
            music distribution in discord.

            Fireside is definitely my go to bot for music. Being able to 
            adjust the volume not only on discord, but through commands 
            aswell without paying is really great. It is so much better than 
            most bots available.

            Fireside bot is a great bot i suggest it to all my friends that have 
            discord servers. It has a lot of utility and features that i use on 
            a daily basis. I love the Rank system and server playlists that it 
            lets you use. 10/10 bot for sure definitly try it out.

            Fireside bot is a fantastic bot for any streaming discord. It is well 
            maintained and being updated regularly and is well on its way to being 
            the only bot needed to help run and maintain my Discord server.
